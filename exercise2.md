# Exercise 2

## Documentation

I used git clone just once because i only work with one repository.
Commands which are used more than once are git add, git stage, git commit, git push.

Order: GIT ADD/STAGE --> (doing the same thing) adding edited files from working directory to the staging area / GIT COMMIT --> commit the new version / GIT PUSH --> loading the new version on the server

I used the parameter -m at git commit command to add a message to the commit. That was the only time i used a parameter except of the config commands.

## Commands

1. **git config**

   Use this command to change or get your user data (email, name)

2. **git init**
  
   Creates new git repository. Same happens with git clone (url).  

3. **git commit**

   All staged files will be moved in the git repository as a new version

4. **git status**

   Shows all files which are ready for the next commit

5. **git add**

   Moves changes from the working directory to the staging area.

6. **git log**

   After a commit git log prints the informations of the last commit and working directory.

7. **git diff**

   With this command you can see the differences between the commit and the working directory.

8. **git pull**

   Gets the actual version from the server

9. **git push**

   Sends the repository to the server
